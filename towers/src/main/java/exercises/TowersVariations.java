/**
 * Exercise 23 — Towers of Hanoi Variation
 * <p>
 * From: Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java (Ch. 3 Recursion)
 * <p>
 * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 * In this variation of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, **every move must use the middle peg**.
 * If the pegs are labeled 1, 2, and 3 (left → right),
 * every disk move must either go:
 * 1 → 2,  2 → 1,  2 → 3, or  3 → 2.
 * You can never move directly between pegs 1 and 3.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE (for 2 rings):
 * move 1 from 1 → 2
 * move 1 from 2 → 3
 * move 2 from 1 → 2
 * move 1 from 3 → 2
 * move 1 from 2 → 1
 * move 2 from 2 → 3
 * move 1 from 1 → 2
 * move 1 from 2 → 3
 * <p>
 * LEARNING GOALS:
 * - Recognize that additional constraints change the recursive pattern.
 * - Modify the recursion to account for “must pass through middle peg.”
 * - Derive and verify the new move-count growth rate.
 * <p>
 * TASKS:
 * 1. Prompt the user for the number of rings (n).
 * 2. If n < 0 → quit.
 * 3. Otherwise, call a recursive method that
 * a) Prints or counts each move.
 * b) Ensures every move uses the middle peg.
 * 4. Report the total number of moves.
 * <p>
 * Hint: Try expressing this variation in terms of TWO standard-style
 * recursive calls — one to move from start to middle, and another
 * from middle to destination.
 * <p>
 * Base case: n == 0 → no moves.
